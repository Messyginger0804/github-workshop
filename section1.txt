Section 1: Introduction to Git and GitHub
- What is Git?
     - Version Control System: Git is a version control system that helps manage changes to source code over time. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each otherâ€™s work.

    - Why Version Control is Important:
        - History: Keep a history of changes made to the codebase, making it easy to revert to previous states.
        - Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on different parts of the project simultaneously.
        - Difference between Git and GitHub.
        - Backup: Acts as a backup system for the source code.
        - Branching: Create separate branches for different features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.

- What is GitHub?
  - Collaboration Platform: GitHub allows multiple developers to collaborate on projects. It facilitates code sharing, review, and contributions from different developers.
  - Repository Hosting: Stores Git repositories in the cloud, making them accessible from anywhere.
  - Additional Features:
    - Pull Requests: Allows developers to discuss and review code changes before merging them into the main branch.
    - Issues: Track bugs, enhancements, and tasks.
    - Actions: Automate workflows like continuous integration and deployment.
    - Wikis: Documentation for projects.
    - Projects: Kanban-style boards for project management.
