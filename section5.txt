Section 5: Pull Requests

Concept of Pull Requests
- Explanation: A pull request (PR) is a way to propose changes to a repository. It allows you to notify team members about changes you've made, initiate discussions about these changes, and review the code before merging it into the main branch.
- Benefits:
  - Code Review: Ensures code quality and consistency.
  - Collaboration: Facilitates discussion and feedback from team members.
  - Quality Control: Helps catch bugs and issues before they are merged.
  - Documentation: Provides a history of why changes were made and who made them.

Creating a Pull Request on GitHub

   - Command: git push origin <branch-name>
   - Explanation: Make sure your changes are pushed to a branch on GitHub.

Steps to Perform a Code Review

2. Review the Code: Look through the code changes, checking for logic errors, coding standards, and potential issues.
